Generalized linear regression models with network-regularization in `R`. Now with `TensorFlow`.

## About

> [!NOTE]
> ⚠️ The package is no longer actively maintained or developed.

Modelling dependencies using linear regression models is often complicated when the 
analysed data-sets are high-dimensional and less observations than variables 
are available (n << p). `netReg` implements generalized linear models 
that utilize network penalties for regularization. Network regularization uses graphs
or trees to incorporate information about interactions of covariables, 
or responses, into the loss function of a GLM. Ideally this allows better (i.e., lower variance)
estimation of regression coefficients. 

For instance, in `R`, you could fit a network-regularized model like that:

```r
> library(netReg)

> X <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 10), 100)
> Y <- matrix(rnorm(100 * 10), 100)

> G.X <- abs(rWishart(1, 10, diag(10))[,,1])
> G.Y <- abs(rWishart(1, 10, diag(10))[,,1])

> fit <- edgenet(X, Y, G.X, G.Y)

> summary(fit)

#>call:
#>edgenet(X = X, Y = Y, G.X = G.X, G.Y = G.Y)

#>parameters:
#>lambda  psigx  psigy 
#>     1      1      1 

#>family:  gaussian
#>link:  identity 

#>-> call coef(x) for coefficients
```

From version `v1.9.0` on, we use `TensorFlow`, instead of custom `C++` and `Dlib`, for
estimation of regression coefficients replacing a custom *cyclic coordinate descent*. This allowed deleting of major parts of the code base.
`netReg` still uses some `RcppArmadillo` for some matrix algebra.

In order to estimate the optimal hyperparameters, i.e., the regularization parameters
of the network models, we use Powell's BOBYQA algorithm in a standard cross-validation framework.

For more details, please check out the respective vignettes of the single models.

## Installation

Before installing the package, make sure to have these Python dependencies installed:

* `tensorflow>=2.2.0`,
* `tensorflow-probabiltiy>=0.10.0`

The easiest way is probably to install `TensorFlow` from `R`

```{r}
install.packages(c("tensorflow", "tfprobability"))
tensorflow::install_tensorflow(extra_packages = "tensorflow-probability")
```

Then install `netReg` by downloading the latest [release](https://github.com/dirmeier/netReg/releases), for instance

```{r}
remotes::install_github("dirmeier/netReg@v1.12.0")
```

## Documentation

* Load the package using `library(netReg)`. We provide vignettes for the package that can be called using: `vignette(package="netReg")`. 
* You can also use the online [vignette](https://dirmeier.github.io/netReg).
